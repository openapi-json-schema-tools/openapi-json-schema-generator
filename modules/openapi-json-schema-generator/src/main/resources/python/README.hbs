- [Migration from Other Python Generators](migration_other_python_generators.md)


## Installation
### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://{{gitHost}}/{{{gitUserId}}}/{{{gitRepoId}}}.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://{{gitHost}}/{{{gitUserId}}}/{{{gitRepoId}}}.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import {{{packageName}}}
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python -m pip install . --user
```
(or `python -m pip install .` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import {{{packageName}}}
```

## Usage Notes
### Validation, Immutability, and Data Type
This python code validates data to schema classes and return back an immutable instance containing the data
which subclasses all validated schema classes. This ensure that
- valid data cannot be mutated and become invalid to a set of schemas
  - the one exception is that files are not immutable, so schema instances storing/sending/receiving files are not immutable
- one can use isinstance to check if a instance or property is valid to a schema class
  - this means that expensive validation does not need to be run twice

Here is the mapping from json schema types to python subclassed types:
| Json Schema Type | Python Base Class |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| object           | immutabledict.immutabledict |
| array            | tuple |
| string           | str |
| number           | float, int |
| integer          | int |
| boolean          | bool |
| null             | None |
| AnyType (unset)  | typing.Union[immutabledict.immutabledict, tuple, str, float, int, bool, None] |

### Storage of Json Schema Definition in Python Classes
In openapi v3.0.3 there are ~ 28 json schema keywords. Almost all of them can apply if
type is unset. This data could be stored as
1. class properties
2. in a container in the class like in a dict or in a nested class

This data is stored in each class that is written for a schema, in a component or
other openapi document location. This class is only responsible for storing schema info.
Output classes like those that store dict payloads are written separately and are
returned by the Schema.validate method when that method is passed in dict input.

TODO add reason here

### Json Schema Type Object
Most component schemas (models) are probably of type object. Which is a map data structure.
Json schema allows string keys in this map, which means schema properties can have key names that are
invalid python variable names. Names like:
- "hi-there"
- "1variable"
- "@now"
- " "
- "from"

To allow these use cases to work, immutabledict.immutabledict is used as the base class of type object schemas.
This means that one can use normal dict methods on instances of these classes.

<details>
  <summary>Other Details</summary>

- optional properties which were not set will not exist in the instance
- None is only allowed in as a value if type: "null" was included or nullable: true was set
- type hints are written for accessing values by key literals like instance["hi-there"]
- required properties with valid python names are accessible with instance.SomeRequiredProp
  which uses the exact key from the openapi document
  - preserving the original key names is required to properly validate a payload to multiple json schemas
</details>

### Json Schema Type + Format, Validated Data Storage
N schemas can be validated on the same payload.
To allow multiple schemas to validate, the data must be stored using one base class whether or not
a json schema format constraint exists in the schema.
See te below accessors for string data:
- type string + format: See .as_date_, .as_datetime_, .as_decimal_, .as_uuid_

In json schema, type: number with no format validates both integers and floats,
so int and float values are stored for type number.

<details>
  <summary>String + Date Example</summary>

For example the string payload '2023-12-20' is validates to both of these schemas:
1. string only
```
- type: string
```
2. string and date format
```
- type: string
  format: date
```
Because of use cases like this, a datetime.date is allowed as an input to this schema, but the data
is stored as a string, with a date accessor, instance.as_date_
